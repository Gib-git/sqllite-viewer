# SQLite Viewer

A web-based SQLite database viewer and editor built with Node.js. Open any `.db`, `.sqlite`, or `.sqlite3` file from your filesystem, browse its contents, edit data, and modify schemas — all from a clean, mobile-friendly UI in your browser.

---

## Features

- **File Browser** — navigate your entire filesystem to select a database file
- **Upload** — drag & drop or upload a file directly from your device
- **Data View** — paginated table grid with sorting, filtering, and configurable page size
- **Row Editing** — add, edit, and delete rows with a modal form
- **Bulk Delete** — select multiple rows with checkboxes and delete in one click
- **Schema View** — inspect columns, types, constraints, indices, foreign keys, and the raw DDL
- **Schema Editing** — rename/drop columns, add columns, rename/drop tables
- **Create Table** — write a `CREATE TABLE` statement to add a new table
- **SQL Editor** — run any SQL query with `Ctrl+Enter` (or `⌘+Enter`), results shown as a table
- **Export CSV** — download any table as a `.csv` file
- **Mobile Friendly** — responsive layout with a collapsible sidebar and touch-friendly controls

---

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later

No native compilation required — SQLite runs via WebAssembly (`sql.js`).

---

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone or download the project
cd "sqllite viewer"

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the server
node server.js
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

To use a different port:

```bash
PORT=8080 node server.js
```

## Usage

### Opening a database

**Browse Files** — click "Browse Files" (header or landing screen) to navigate your filesystem. Folders and SQLite files are shown; click a file to open it.

**Upload** — click "Upload" or drag & drop a file onto the landing screen. Uploaded files are stored temporarily in the `uploads/` folder.

### Viewing data

Select a table from the left sidebar. The **Data** tab shows a paginated grid:

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Click a column header | Sort ascending/descending |
| Search box | Filter visible rows |
| Rows dropdown | Change page size (25 / 50 / 100 / 250) |
| Row checkbox | Select rows for bulk delete |
| Edit button | Open edit modal for that row |
| Delete button | Delete that single row |

### Editing data

- **Add Row** — click the green "Add Row" button. Fill in field values and click "Insert Row".
- **Edit Row** — click the "Edit" button on any row. Modify values and click "Save Changes".
- **Delete Row(s)** — check one or more rows, then click the red "Delete (n)" button.

### Schema

Click the **Schema** tab for the active table to:

- View all columns with their type, constraints (PK, NOT NULL), and default values
- **Rename a column** — click "Rename" next to a column
- **Drop a column** — click "Drop" next to a column (cannot drop primary key columns)
- **Add a column** — click "+ Add Column", choose a name, type, and optional NOT NULL + default
- **Rename the table** — type a new name and click "Rename"
- **Drop the table** — click "Drop Table" (with confirmation)
- View indices, foreign keys, and the raw `CREATE TABLE` statement

### Creating a table

Click the **+** icon at the top of the sidebar to open the "Create New Table" dialog. Enter a valid `CREATE TABLE` SQL statement and click "Create Table".

### SQL Editor

Click the **SQL** tab to open the query editor. Write any SQL and run it with:

- `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows / Linux)
- `⌘+Enter` (macOS)
- Or click the "Run Query" button

`SELECT` queries display results as a table. Other statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, etc.) display the number of affected rows.

### Exporting

Click **Export CSV** in the content header to download the current table as a comma-separated file.

## Project Structure

```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js |
| Web server | Express |
| SQLite engine | [sql.js](https://sql.js.org/) (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly) |
| File uploads | Multer |
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript — no framework |

Using `sql.js` means no native compilation is needed, so the app installs and runs on any platform without build tools.

## Notes

- The database is loaded into memory when opened. Changes are written back to disk after every write operation. For very large databases (> 500 MB) this may use significant RAM.
- Uploaded files are stored in `uploads/` relative to the project directory. You can delete this folder at any time.
- The file browser can access any path your OS user has read permission for.
